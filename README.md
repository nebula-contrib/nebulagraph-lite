Try NebulaGraph with `pip install`, on Linux/ WSL2 or even [Google Colab](https://bit.ly/nebula-colab)!

## How to use

> Install NebulaGraph Lite

```bash
pip3 install nebulagraph-lite
```

> Start NebulaGraph Lite from Jupyter Notebook

```python
from nebulagraph_lite import nebulagraph_let as ng_let

> Start NebulaGraph Lite from CLI:

```bash
nebulagraph start
```

</details>

Voil√†! It'ts up and running already now!

## What's next

Play with `nebula3-python` or [ipython-ngql](https://github.com/wey-gu/ipython-ngql) and walk through the [Documentation](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/)!

```bash
pip3 install ipython-ngql
%load_ext ngql
```

And we could access it like:

```python
%ngql --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9669 --user root --password nebula
```

And query like:

```python
%ngql SHOW HOSTS;
```

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Click to see FAQ</summary>

### Why not docker?

With udocker, the opinionated subset docker running in user space, we could run docker images without root privilege, docker daemon.

Thus we support running inside docker container, WSL2, Google Colab.

### Can NebulaGraph-Lite run inside a container?

Yes! Say we are in a container that runs Ubuntu, we could run:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest bash
# inside the container
apt update && apt install python3-pip curl -y
pip3 install nebulagraph-lite
python3
```

In python3:

```python
from nebulagraph_lite import nebulagraph_let as ng_let
n = ng_let(in_container=True)
n.start()
```

Or in shell:

```bash
nebulagraph --container start
```

### Does it support Windows?

Yes, it supports Windows with WSL2 or other Linux VMs with a Hypervisor.

### How to clean up?

- Step 1, from nebulagraph-lite, remove the udocker container and clean up the base path.

Python:

```python
n.stop()
n.clean_up()
```

Shell:

```bash
nebulagraph stop
nebulagraph cleanup
```

- Step 2, pip uninstall nebulagraph-lite and dependencies.

```bash
pip3 uninstall nebulagraph-lite udocker
```

- Step 3, remove the udocker files.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.udocker
```

- Step 4, kill the left processes, in case of any.

```bash
ss -plunt | grep "9559\|9669\|9779"
# if any, kill them with killall or other tools

killall -9 nebula-graphd
killall -9 nebula-storaged
killall -9 nebula-metad
```
