Try NebulaGraph with `pip install`, on Linux/ WSL2 or even [Google Colab](https://bit.ly/nebula-colab)!

## How to use

> Install NebulaGraph Lite

```bash
pip3 install nebulagraph-lite
```

> Start NebulaGraph Lite from Jupyter Notebook

```python
from nebulagraph_lite import nebulagraph_let as ng_let

n = ng_let()

n.start()
```

Voil√†! It'ts up and running already now!

## What's next

Play with `nebula3-python` or [ipython-ngql](https://github.com/wey-gu/ipython-ngql) and walk through the [Documentation](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/)!

```bash
pip3 install ipython-ngql
%load_ext ngql
```

And we could access it like:

```python
%ngql --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9669 --user root --password nebula
```

And query like:

```python
%ngql SHOW HOSTS;
```
